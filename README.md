Here is the data scraping, corresponding to the images :

### Data Scraping Documentation

The following images represent different stages of data scraping from a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin. The purpose of this process is to extract structured data for further analysis or integration into other systems.

#### Image 1: Database Tables Overview
- **Description:** This image displays a list of tables in a MySQL database accessed via phpMyAdmin. Each table contains different datasets, including admissions, courses, feedback, and more. The image highlights various actions such as browsing, searching, and dropping tables, which are typical operations when managing or extracting data.
- **Purpose:** To provide a clear view of the database structure, allowing the identification of relevant tables for data scraping.
- **Usage:** This image can be used to identify which tables to target for scraping, depending on the required data. It serves as a reference for understanding the database schema before performing any scraping operations.

#### Image 2: Migration Records Table
- **Description:** This image captures the migration records table that logs changes made to the database schema over time. It includes migration IDs, app names, and timestamps. The image is crucial for understanding the evolution of the database and ensuring that the scraping process targets the correct version of the data.
- **Purpose:** To ensure that data scraping is performed on the correct and most up-to-date database schema by reviewing the migration history.
- **Usage:** Use this table to verify that the database schema is stable and consistent with the intended structure before beginning the data extraction process.

#### Image 3: Product Data Extraction
- **Description:** This image shows a table of product data, including product IDs, titles, pricing information, descriptions, brands, stock status, and associated images. This data is typically extracted for use in e-commerce applications, where it can be displayed on a website or analyzed for business insights.
- **Purpose:** To provide an example of the type of structured data that can be scraped from the database, highlighting key fields that are often of interest in commercial applications.
- **Usage:** This image can be used to explain the process of extracting specific product data fields for integration into e-commerce platforms or for conducting market analysis.
